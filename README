## Project Overview

2D puzzle game built around the idea of **using bugs and unintended behaviours as core mechanics**.  
The game is presented from a Pokémon-style top-down perspective, encouraging players to observe, experiment, and exploit systemic inconsistencies to progress.

## Design Focus

- Puzzle design based on **rule-breaking and edge cases**
- Turning bugs from errors into **intentional player tools**
- Encouraging player curiosity through trial, failure, and discovery

Rather than hiding bugs, the game exposes them as readable systems that players can learn, predict, and manipulate.

## Gameplay Concept

Players navigate a top-down 2D world where certain interactions behave “incorrectly” by conventional game logic.  
Progress is achieved not by following intended rules, but by **understanding how the system breaks** and using those breaks to solve puzzles.

Examples include:
- Collisions behaving inconsistently
- State changes persisting when they should reset
- Movement or interaction rules behaving differently under specific conditions

## My Role

- Game design and puzzle concept
- System definition and iteration
- Playtesting and refinement of bug-based mechanics

## Notes

This project prioritises design experimentation and systemic exploration over production polish.  
The focus is on how players interpret, learn, and exploit rules rather than on technical optimisation.
